All the key are configurable. Go into the Quake internal menu ("customize controls")

(or modify the text file /sdcard/baseq2/config.cfg )

For the phones with a physical keyboard (like Motorola Droid), it is possible to have all the controls by remapping the keys of the physical keyboard.

(the configuration is saved automatically, therefor you have to do it only the first time )

For the phones without a physical keyboard (like Samsung Galaxy), it is possible to use the virtual key, located on the touchscreen :

-----------------------
| AUX1  | AUX2 | AUX3 |
|--------------|------|
|              | AUX6 |
|     VIEW     |------|
|              | AUX9 |
-----------------------

With the default configuration  (see the screen "tools" ..), you get the following mapping :

AUX1 => free
AUX2 => free
AUX3 => next weapon
AUX6 => jump
AUX9 => crouch

Regarding the VIEW area of the touchscreen, it can be used for precise aiming :
press the VIEW are, moves are stopped, and controle the crosshair with the finger.

Then for shooting, press the center button of the DPAD ( = ENTER usually mapped on +attack)

To move, you can use either the arrow from the DPAD, or the sensors :

- tilt your phone to move forward or backward 
- rotate your phone on the side in order to turn right or left

The more you tilt, the faster you move ...

In order to stop moving, keep your phone with an inclination of around 50 degrees 
(you need to get used to  ..)

IMPORTANT : each time you press the view area, the current inclination is taken as reference for the next moves 


(if the mode "sensor" bothers you, you can disengage it in the screen "settings")
